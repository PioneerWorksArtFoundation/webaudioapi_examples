# webaudioapi_examples
Examples and tutorials on how to use web audio api &amp; tone.js.

Curated by Lucas White for Pioneer Works.

Utilizes [Middle Ear Media's Web Audio API Buffer Loader](https://middleearmedia.com/web-audio-api-bufferloader/) and [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/)

## Setup
Upon downloading, the `monoSynth.html` and `polySynth.html` pages should run locally. For the `drumPad.html`, however, you will need to run a server to grant access to the files from the page. You can do this by `cd`ing to the directory and typing the following code:`python -m SimpleHTTPServer 5000`. Then, navigate to `localhost:5000/drumPad.html`. You can also solve this issue by hosting it on a website.
